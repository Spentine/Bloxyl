## About
   Bloxyl is a multipurpose geometric font designed for use in games and futuristic-related content. It is completely free to use and is under the Open Font License. It is designed fully by [Spentine](https://github.com/Spentine). The font is a work in progress, so revisions and updates may be added to the font at any time. Previous versions can still be accessed through its inclusion in the fonts folder or through GitHub's revision history. The latest version of the font may be downloaded at the [website](spentine.github.io/Bloxyl/web/).

   Many modern typography features are not yet in the font, such as kerning and the presence of ligatures. Spacing may look off due to the lack of kerning and the slanted design of the font. The extra features may be added in a later update. The font supports a small variety of characters, mostly within the Extended ASCII range (U+0000 to U+00FF).

## Design
   The font is designed to be geometric, modern, and unique. The font is centered around the presence of cuts near the ends of lines. The cuts slant the font and provides a level of close-up precision. The numbers are monospaced to prevent jittering when being incremented or changed. The design was also partially influenced by CJK characters due to the planning of their conjunction with the Latin script.
   Before the development of the Latin script for the font, various radicals (components of CJK characters) and hiragana (one of the three Japanese scripts) were created. Currently, it is not in the font.
